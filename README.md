I am writing to inform you of my resignation from my position as [Your Job Title] at [Company Name]. This decision has not been easy, but I need to prioritize caring for my parents, whose health requires my full attention and support at this time.

I understand that the standard notice period is [two weeks/one month], and I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition. However, if it would be possible to relieve me of my duties earlier, I would be extremely grateful, as my family situation is quite pressing.

I want to express my sincere appreciation for the opportunities I've had here and for the support from you and the team. I've valued my time at [Company Name] and have learned a great deal that I will carry forward.

Please let me know how I can best assist during this transition period, whether that's documenting my current projects, training a replacement, or any other handover tasks you need completed.

Thank you for your understanding during this difficult time.
